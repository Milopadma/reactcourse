# reactcourse
 A course iâ€™m taking from Udemy about React and Redux. This repository contains test react projects for learning, do not expect perfect apps in this repository! ðŸ˜…

 There are multiple folders inside this repository, each folder is its own app. A quick explanation of each app is shown below;

 - react-course-1 : an app that uses fakerjs to show 'comments' of people, showing how to use the react props and components.

 - react-course-2 : an app that gets the geolocation and time of the user and display the appropriate season of the user's location. this app uses the react's class components system to display states, utilize the lifecycle methods and more props functionality.

 - react-course-3 : an app that utilizes the Unsplash API to return images from a user input in the search bar. this app acts as practice for user input with forms and events, making API requests with react, and using Ref's for accessing the DOM.

- react-course-4 : using the YouTube API to fetch videos and display them in the UI depending on what the user inputted in the search field. this app utilizes the class component system, lifecycle methods, API requests, forms, event callback functions and props; basically everything I have learned up to this point.

- react-course-5 : utilizing the useState and useEffect hook, this app updates its state and fetches wikipedia articles whenever the user types in the search field. using the setTimeout function of Javascript, the API fetch is throttled so it does not call on every character input.
